# Julie Neuron (JN)
> An add-on for deep learning framework DeepFrame, CUDA and OpenCL. 

## This repository only includes original C++ source code of deep learning
## With JN, a quick graph construction mechanism is introduced so that more complex deep networks can be created more easily.
## This reporsitory is collaborated with Ning Xu (xuningandy@outlook.com).

Apology for the possible delay due to pandemics, we are working to our full extent. This extra framework is derived from another repository named DeepFrame. We 

## There are 3 versions of JN ##
* This neuron library currently supports CPU. 
* The CUDA version is quickly under development and test (Under BitBucket, links will be shown here when done).
* The OpenCL version is under early-stage development (Under BitBucket, links will be shown here when done).

## There are 3 components in this repository: ##

* The **julie_neurons** directory which includes the framework itself
* The **test** directory which includes unit test cases
* The **demo** directory including some demos
* For **demo**, you need to **change the path to your own working directory**.

## You can go to each diretory to build the library and demos following README manuals. ##
